# SimpleVideoManager
A simple program that allows you to copy videos from an SD card. The videos are renamed with date and time. Designed for four GoPros.

The program contains the four names of my cameras. This can easily be changed in the code.
The filenames are currently running as follows: "yyMMdd_HHmm_CAMNAME.mp4"

The program is in German

A compiled app can be found in the folder "debug"
